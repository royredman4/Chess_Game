# Chess_Game

This is a GUI chess program that runs purely off of Tkinter. Tkinter is usually included with pythons standard library, so you shouldn't need anything accept for python to run this program. If there is an error that Tkinter is not installed, when you try running it, Tkinters website has some useful information on how to install it (http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html).

In order to run the program, run the GUI.py file (that is the main startup file)

Please recognize that this project is not finished yet, and may not be finished for a while. This message will be removed when it is complete. This program should run perfectly under any operating system you choose, so feel free to try it out, and leave me any comments or suggestions about it (royredman4@gmail.com). Here are some pictures of the program:
